# learn-ruby-the-hard-way
My solutions to https://learnrubythehardway.org/book

I am finished with this book - the later exercises include extensive projects which I have no interest in completing (mostly text-based games). Some later exercises include creating a project structure and using the `sinatra` project to create a web project. I would rather refer to official documentation for creating libraries and projects or using any non-standard gems/pacakges.
